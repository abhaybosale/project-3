# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

In this project, I have created an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. I have created routes to manage 'minions', brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to busy schedule.


It is one of the projects of codecademy backend engineering course
